# 🧭 Sprint Log — Week of Oct 6–12, 2025

**Sprint Goal:** Complete Compliance Platform Auth System (register → login → verifyToken → protected route)  
**Secondary Goal:** Re-establish daily CI/CD commits and build/test automation.

---

## 🗓 Monday, Oct 6
- 🎯 Focus: Re-structuring backlog and restoring daily integration rhythm.
- ✅ Updated `Backlog.md` with Active Development Queue.
- ✅ Clarified Precision Execution Plan for ERP workflow alignment.
- ⚙️ Reviewed middleware stack (execution order, chaining, error handling).
- 🧠 Finalized Auth flow structure (routes → middleware → controller → DB).
- 💡 Key Insight: Validation and error-handling must precede controller execution.
- 🔜 Next: Implement register/login routes + JWT verification.

---

## 🗓 Wednesday, Oct 8 (Planned)
- 🎯 Focus: Implement `/register` and `/login` with bcrypt + JWT.
✅ Refactored ADR-0001–0005 to modern Compliance Platform context.
💡 Project now has production-grade DB, ORM, and scaling strategy.
- 🧩 Tasks:
  - Finish route wiring and controller logic.
  - Add token signing (`HS256`) and secure `.env` usage.
  - Test via Postman: successful register/login cycle.
- 🧠 Learning Objective: reinforce bcrypt hashing and token payload understanding.
- ✅ Deliverable: working Auth routes, documented in `AuthSystem.md`.

---

## 🗓 Thursday, Oct 9 (Planned)
- 🎯 Focus: Implement JWT verification middleware (`authenticate.js`).
- 🧩 Tasks:
  - Parse and verify token.
  - Attach `req.user` to request.
  - Add protected `/me` route for verification.
- 🧠 Learning Objective: middleware chaining + error propagation.
- ✅ Deliverable: successful token verification tested via Postman.
