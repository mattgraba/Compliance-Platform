# 🧭 Compliance Platform — Weekly Summary

**Week:** Oct 6–12, 2025  
**Sprint Theme:** Complete Auth System + Reinstate Daily CI/CD  
**Prepared by:** Matthew Graba  

---

## 🧱 1. Summary Overview
| Category | Summary |
|-----------|----------|
| **Primary Focus** | Auth System (register → login → verifyToken) |
| **Secondary Focus** | CI/CD consistency + documentation pipeline |
| **Overall Outcome** | 🚧 Auth routes functional; JWT verification WIP; CI/CD structure restored. |
| **Confidence Level** | 🔹 Building steadily — systems thinking solidifying |

---

## 🚀 2. Weekly Wins
- ✅ Updated and refined **Backlog.md** with Active Development Queue.  
- ✅ Built and integrated **meta tracking suite** (Sprint Log, CI Checklist, Auth Todo, Friction Log).  
- ✅ Completed `validateRequest` and `handleError` middleware setup.  
- ✅ Deepened understanding of **Express middleware order** and **JWT fundamentals**.  
- ✅ Established daily routine under **Precision Execution Plan**.

---

## ⚠️ 3. Friction Themes (from `FrictionLog.md`)
| Type | Description | Resolution |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| 🧠 Concept | Middleware execution order confusion | Reordered stack, documented flow |
| 🧱 Environment | WSL2 / cURL virtualization issue | Enabled BIOS virtualization, validated setup |
| ⚙️ Integration | (Placeholder for Auth bugs) | TBD after JWT implementation |

---

## 🧩 4. Key Learnings
- Middleware is **sequential**; order dictates logic flow.  
- Validation and error handling must **precede controllers**.  
- JWT verification requires aligned secrets between environments.  
- CI/CD checklists reduce context loss between pushes.  
- Friction Logs = high-leverage reflection tools — small notes now prevent huge confusion later.

---

## 🧠 5. Knowledge Reinforcement
- [x] Express Middleware Lifecycle  
- [x] bcrypt password hashing  
- [ ] JWT verification deep dive (`jwt.verify`, expiry, error states)  
- [ ] Refresh token design pattern  
- [ ] Environment consistency for local vs CI/CD

## 🧰 6. CI/CD Health Snapshot
| Metric | Count | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| ✅ Successful Builds |  | |
| ⚠️ Failed Builds |  | |
| 🔄 Recovery Time |  | |

---

## 🎯 7. Next Week’s Sprint Focus (Oct 13–19)
**Theme:** Finalize Auth System & Begin RBAC groundwork  

### Goals
- [ ] Finish `/verifyToken` middleware + protected `/me` route.  
- [ ] Add refresh token endpoint (optional).  
- [ ] Begin `roles` + `user_roles` schema expansion.  
- [ ] Initialize Docker setup for local dev parity.  
- [ ] Automate Postman collection tests in CI/CD pipeline.

**Notes to Self:**
- Keep CI/CD momentum daily — green builds build confidence.  
- Continue balancing learning depth with consistent commits.  
- Refactor docs as living systems, not archives.
