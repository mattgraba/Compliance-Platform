# 2025-09-15 -- Cannabis Compliance: AI Automation
> Implementing IDE Scratchpad Habit

## Template Guide

### Tag Entries
Use simple markdown markes while jotting:
- `CONCEPT` → something belongs in [Concepts](../concepts/)
- `DECISION` → something belongs in [ADR](../architecture/adr/)
- `HOWTO` → [Recipe](../guides/recipes/)
- `OPEN` -> open question/backlog
- **Example**:
    - `CONCEPT`: Audit Logs need to link every compliance gate → belongs in concepts/audit-logs.md
    - `DECISION`: Will start AI automation with single-log analysis → ADR candidate
    - `HOWTO`: Recipe for adding new compliance gate to automation pipeline
    - `OPEN`: How to handle training verification in Phase 1?

### Graduate Notes into Docs on Milestones
At the end of a feature or learning sprint:
- Scan `journal/` for `CONCEPT:` → promote to `/concepts`
- Scan for `DECISION`: → write ADR (template already exists)
- Scan for `HOWTO`: → stub or complete a recipe
- Copy `OPEN`: into docs/Backlog.md

### Use ADRs & Backlog as Anchors
- **ADRs** capture decisions (so we don’t re-litigate later).
- **Backlog.md** captures “I should doc this later” without breaking our flow.
- This prevents us from derailing into “doc-OCD” mid-build.

### Daily Wrap-Up Habit
At the end of a coding/learning block:
1. Commit code as usual.
2. Copy/paste our scratch notes into docs/journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md.
3. Add a quick commit like:
```makefile
docs: journal notes for Sept 15 (AI Automation Phase 1 kickoff)
```
That way, even if we never polish them, our thought process is versioned and searchable.
4. Copy unresolved OPEN items into docs/Backlog.md.

## Audit Automation (`/audit-automation/analyze`)

- **HOWTO**: Route will take auditlog JSON → send to OpenAI → return enriched log
- **DECISION**: MVP will only support single log entry (not batch)
- **CONCEPT**: AI summaries can serve as compliance "lens" across audit logs

### End of day:
- Promote the `DECISION` into `adr/0003-ai-automation-mvp.md`.
- Leave the `HOWTO` in journal for now → stub later into `recipes/Analyze-AuditLogs.md`.
- The `CONCEPT` eventually grows into `concepts/ai-automation.md`.
