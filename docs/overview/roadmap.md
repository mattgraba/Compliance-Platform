# Phased Implementation Roadmap for AI Automation in Cannabis Compliance
---
## Phase 1 - Automate Lab Results Ingestion (OCR + Parsing)
**Goal**: Replace manual entry of potency results with automated ingestion.
- **Tasks**:
    - Use **OCR** (Tesseract or AWS Textract) to extract data (THC %, CBD %, weight) from PDF Certificates of Analysis (COAs).
    - Parse and validate structured data (JSON format).
    - Insert into our DB with an API endpoint (`/lab-results/ingest`)
    - Build error handling (e.g., unreadable scans -> flag for manual review)
- **Skills Practiced:**
OCR, Python/Node automation, input validation, API desgin.
- **Outcome:**
Compliance bot that turns unstructured lab PDFs into structured DB entries

## Placeholder for remaining phases
```bash
Phase 2 – QA/QC Auto-Checker (Rule-Based + AI Validation)

Goal: Automatically verify data integrity and flag compliance risks.

Tasks:

Create rules (e.g., THC must not exceed state maximums, total weight consistency).

Use AI/NLP (OpenAI API) to cross-check anomalies like “field missing,” “inconsistent units.”

Build a dashboard to display flagged issues with CAPA workflow (Corrective and Preventive Action).

Skills Practiced:
Rules-based logic, NLP, compliance exception handling, frontend dashboards.

Outcome:
Automated QC system that reduces human error in compliance reporting.

Phase 3 – SOP Digitization & Training Logs

Goal: Automate SOP and training compliance checks.

Tasks:

Store SOPs as structured digital documents with versioning (change management).

Use NLP to detect missing required sections (e.g., “safety measures” in pesticide SOP).

Track employee training logs → auto-flag expired/missing certs.

Generate reminders via email/Slack webhooks.

Skills Practiced:
Document AI, version control, RBAC, notifications/webhooks.

Outcome:
A Digital SOP + Training Platform, matching one of the top compliance needs we flagged (“top shelf”).

Phase 4 – State Integration (APIs & RPA)

Goal: Connect our system with external compliance systems.

Tasks:

Integrate with METRC/BioTrack APIs where possible.

If no API access → simulate RPA with Puppeteer/Playwright (login → form-fill → report submission).

Set up event-driven architecture (webhooks) for “auto-reporting” triggered by system actions.

Skills Practiced:
External APIs, RPA techniques, event-driven design, DevOps automation.

Outcome:
Compliance system that auto-submits or syncs data to regulators.

Phase 5 – Full Audit & Reporting System

Goal: Provide regulators and auditors with automated, export-ready compliance reports.

Tasks:

Immutable audit logs (RBAC + tenant scope).

Automated CAPA reports (generate PDF summaries of flagged incidents + resolution logs).

Environmental reporting tools (CO₂ usage, pesticide logging) as an advanced feature.

Build dashboard for real-time compliance health.

Skills Practiced:
Audit log engineering, advanced reporting, PDF generation, governance compliance.

Outcome:
Enterprise-grade audit & reporting module
